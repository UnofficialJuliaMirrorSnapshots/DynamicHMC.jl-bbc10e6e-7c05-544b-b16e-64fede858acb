*Please make sure you are using **the latest tagged versions** and **the last stable release of Julia** before proceeding.* Support for other versions is very limited.

If you need *help* using this package for Bayesian inference, please provide a self-contained description of your inference problem (simplifying if possible) and preferably the code you have written so far to code the log likelihood.

If you found a *bug*, please provide a self-contained working example, complete with (simulated) data. Please make sure you set a random seed (`Random.seed!`) at the beginning to make your example reproducible.

If you are requesting a new *feature*, please provide a description and a rationale.
